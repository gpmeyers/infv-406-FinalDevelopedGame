Final Developed Game for University of Arizona course INFV 406 Introduction to Game Development

Title: Block Run

This Project is an endless runner where the player is on a suspended platform that they must stay on while avoiding obstacles. Falling off the platform or running into an obstacle will result in a loss and restart. New features might be added in the future depending on time and resources.

Release version 1.0.0 is finished and playable:

Future updates to the game might include adding platforms to jump on, a coin system, powerups, etc. I wanted to make sure the game was smooth and simple for the project submission
